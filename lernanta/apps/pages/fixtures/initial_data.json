P2PU creates a model for lifelong learning alongside traditional formal higher education. Leveraging the internet and educational materials openly available online, P2PU enables high-quality low-cost education opportunities. P2PU - learning for everyone, by everyone about almost anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><object height=\"300\" width=\"400\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=11158136&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=11158136&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\"></embed></object></p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Values</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The following values and principles are the foundation of P2PU: <strong>openness, community, peer learning</strong>. We are articulating these values in order to guide our actions, but P2P has always been about doing, and our actions will in turn help us probe and refine these values.</p> \r\n<p><strong>P2PU is open</strong>: Open sharing and collaboration enable participation, innovation, and accountability. Our community is open so that everyone can participate. Our content is open so that everyone can use it. Our model and technology are open to enable experimentation and ongoing improvement. And our processes are open so that we are accountable to our community.</p> \r\n<p><strong>P2PU is a community</strong>: P2PU is a community-centric project and our governance model reflects that. P2PU is driven by volunteers, who are involved in all aspects of the project. As members of this community, we speak and act with civility, tolerance, and respect for other opinions, people, and perspectives. We strive for quality as a community driven process of review, feedback and revision. </p> \r\n<p><strong>P2PU is passionate about peer learning</strong>: P2PU is teaching and learning by peers for peers. Everyone has something to contribute and everyone has something to learn. We are all teachers and we are all learners. We take responsibility for our own and each others learning.</p> \r\n \r\n<h2>Project Map</h2> \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\tTwo years ago P2PU started with five people and has since grown into a community of about 1,000. During this time, P2PU has run three cycles (semesters) of courses, with the number of courses offered doubling each time. Organizers of P2PU courses are volunteers who submit their course idea and receive guidance from a wide array of experts and community members to create a comprehensive syllabus of open materials and a social structure around them. Our current trajectory involves designing a community-supported mentoring system for organizers and participants as we scale. At the next level, we are partnering with external organizations to cluster courses and create reputable schools of open learning with definitive career trajectories. A shining example is the P2PU/Mozilla School of Webcraft. Synergistic partnerships with organizations of clout provide P2PU participants with a credible open education.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>P2PU Staff</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>P2PU is made up of a large community of committed and enthusiastic volunteers, and a small team of staff. The following people are part of the P2PU staff who keep things running smoothly:</p>\r\n\r\n<div id='member_relationships'>\r\n<ul class=\"following\">\r\n<li><a title=\"Philipp Schmidt, Director\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/Philipp\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/philipp.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Bekka Kahn, Mother, Wrangler\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/Rebecca%20Kahn\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/rebecca.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Alison Cole, Guide\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/alison\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/alison.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Karen Gabriels, Treasurer, a treasure\" href=\"http://p2pu.org/en/karengabriels\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/karen.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"John Britton, Evangelist\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/johndbritton\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/john.jpeg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Zuzel Vera, Tech Guru\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/zuzelvp\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/zuzel.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2> \r\n\tAccreditation</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tWhile learning in itself is a valuable goal, getting credit for what you&#39;ve done is also important to gain social and economic opportunities. As P2PU develops, we are experimenting with new ways of recognising learning. Assessment of each other becomes intrinsic in the community learning process. Like open source software communities, the participants in a learning group provide feedback to each other, reviewing and improving each others&#39; work. Peers in the course will assess each others&#39; work and P2PU online certificates will be offered to signal that you&#39;ve completed a course. We want learners to get recognition for their achievements, but we don&#39;t issue any kind of accredited or official certificates ourselves. We are working on cross-accreditation with a few partners, but P2PU certificates are more &quot;artworks&quot; than &quot;degrees&quot;.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2> \r\n\tSupport</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU is largely run by volunteers, however we have also gotten seed funding to cover some basic costs from both the Hewlett Foundation, and the Shuttleworth Foundation. The University of California at Irvine has generously offered to incubate us and help with administrative and legal support. You can learn more about our fantastic supporters <a href=\"/pages/supporters\">here</a>. Thanks!!!</p> \r\n\r\n<h2> \r\n\tCollaborations</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU is working with a number of different people and organizations on many different facets of its development. In particular, P2PU would like to recognize the efforts of: the staff of <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a> for their advice and collaborative awareness-raising and research support; etc.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Research Opportunities</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tAs P2PU is in its beginning phases we are open to others who wish to monitor our progress for research purposes. The field of online learning and open / peer2peer learning and collaboration is in rapid development, both when it comes to available technological platforms and social models for organizing. We have been inspired by a number of very successful pilots and see the P2PU as building on these pioneering courses. We will be continually monitoring and evaluating the progress, making many changes along the way and hopefully developing new models of collaboration which not only benefit P2PU but also other projects in which communities of volunteers attempt to work together. We will actively promote and support research, especially action research, on the P2PU model and make it a priority to share information and reflections with the larger community on a regular basis. The P2PU will look very different in three or five years from how it looked when we started it, but the only way to get there is to jump in and try. We invite anyone interested in doing research on the P2PU to contact us.</p> \r\n\r\n",

            "content": "<p> \r\nPeer 2 Peer University (&quot;P2PU&quot;) cares about the personal data of its users. These Privacy Guidelines explain the collection, use and disclosure of &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; across all P2PU Web sites hosted under the p2pu.org domain (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.p2pu.org\" title=\"www.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.p2pu.org</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.p2pu.org\" title=\"blog.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog.p2pu.org, <a href=\"http://archive.p2pu.org\"  title=\"archive.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.p2pu.org</a>, <a href=\"http://wiki.p2pu.org\" title=\"wiki.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki.p2pu.org</a>, etc.).</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\tAs used in this policy, &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number or email address.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tOpenness Principles</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU is an open and transparent organization. In that spirit, we share as much information as possible about our products, services, operations, and associations. Users who interact with P2PU Web sites should therefore understand and be aware that any personally-identifying information provided to P2PU may be made available to the public. There are three exceptions to this broad principle, explained below.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tVisitors to P2PU Web Sites</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tExcept as described below, P2PU does not collect or require visitors to its Web sites to furnish personal information. Like most Web site operators, P2PU collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preferences, referring site, and date and time of each visitor request. P2PU also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU&#39;s purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how P2PU&#39;s visitors use its Web sites. To that end, P2PU may share potentially personally-identifying information with its employees, contractors, volunteers, and its subsidiaries and related organizations. P2PU may also release non-personally-identifying information about visitors (e.g., by publishing a report on Web site usage trends). Otherwise, P2PU will not publicly release potentially personally-identifying information except under the same circumstances as P2PU releases personally-identifying information. Those circumstances are explained below.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tCommunity Members</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tCertain members of the P2PU community (course organizers, participants, etc.) choose to interact with P2PU in ways that require P2PU and others to know more about them. The amount and type of information that P2PU gathers from those members depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, members who wish to post content to certain portions of P2PU&#39;s Web sites or participate in live chat session(s) are asked to provide usernames that identify that content as having been posted by a particular member. P2PU asks course leaders and participants to create user profiles, which may include photographs and personal descriptions. Members who are registered and sign in to the P2PU website are able to contact members through their profiles. Contact information such as email addresses are not publicly available on the P2PU Web site, however if a user sends email through the website, that user&rsquo;s email address will be revealed to the recipient.</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\tCourse leaders and participants in the same course are likely to obtain personally-identifying information for the purposes of collaboration and communication in the course itself. P2PU is not responsible for the disclosure of personally-identifying contact information that is volutntarily revealed when participating in a course.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tExceptions</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tAs a general rule, users should assume that that any personally-identifying information provided through P2PU&#39;s Web sites will be made available to the public. There are three broad exceptions to that rule:</p> \r\n<ul> \r\n<li> \r\n\t\tP2PU does not make publicly available information that is used to authenticate users the publication of which would compromise the security of P2PU&#39;s Web sites (e.g., passwords).</li> \r\n<li> \r\n\t\tP2PU does not make publicly available information that it specifically promises at the time of collection to maintain in confidence.</li> \r\n<li> \r\n\t\tP2PU does not publicly release information gathered in connection with commercial transactions (i.e., transactions involving money).</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tInteractive Product Features</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tCertain P2PU products or services may contain features that report, or that permit users to report, the user&#39;s usage patterns to P2PU. The reports generated by these features typically include non-personally-identifying information such as the configuration of the user&#39;s computer and the code running at the time the problem occurred. Some of the features give users the option of providing personally-identifying information. P2PU may analyze the information provided by these interactive product features to develop a better understanding of how its products are being used.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tProtection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tWhere P2PU has collected personally-identifying information subject to one of the three exceptions described in the Community Members section, above, it discloses that information only to those of its employees, volunteers, contractors and its subsidiaries and related organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on P2PU&#39;s behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, volunteers, contractors and subsidiaries and related organizations may be located outside of a visitor&#39;s home country; by using P2PU&#39;s Web sites, the visitor consents to the transfer of his/her information to them. P2PU does not rent or sell such information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors or its subsidiaries and related organizations, as described above, P2PU discloses such information only when required to do so by law, or when P2PU believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of P2PU, members of the P2PU community, or the public at large.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tUpdating of Personally-Identifying Information</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU permits users to freely update and correct their personally-identifying information as maintained by P2PU. To do so, users should look for links or contact information available on whichever P2PU Web sites store the relevant information, or contact P2PU by email. Users are permitted to deactivate their profile, however, contributions to the P2PU Web site will not be removed when the profile is deactivated.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tChildren</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU&#39;s Web sites are not directed at children under the age of 13. Consistent with the United States Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Our Terms of Use expressly state that users must be over the age of 18 to use P2PU&#39;s Web sites. Any person who provides their personal information to P2PU through the Web sites represents that they are 18 years of age or older.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tCookies and Clear GIFs</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>What Are Cookies? -- </strong>A cookie is a string of information that a Web site stores on a visitor&#39;s computer, and that the visitor&#39;s browser provides to the Web site each time the visitor returns. Most major web sites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to &quot;recognize&quot; a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in P2PU cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with P2PU and, where applicable, its third party service provider.</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>What Are Clear GIFs? --</strong> Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help web site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. It makes it easer to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website.</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>How We Use Cookies and Clear GIFs. --</strong> P2PU&#39;s Web sites use cookies and may use clear gifs in the future. These tools help P2PU identify and track visitors, their usage of P2PU Web sites, and their Web site access preferences across multiple requests and visits to P2PU&#39;s Web sites. The basic idea is to gather aggregate data about how people use the P2PU Web sites. The term usually used to describe this is &quot;web analytics&quot; and the cookies and clear gifs are the tools by which a website owner collects this web analytics data. P2PU will use the web analytics data only to determine aggregate usage patterns for our Web sites as described above. P2PU uses the information provided by cookies and clear gifs to develop a better understanding of how P2PU&#39;s visitors use P2PU&#39;s Web sites, and to facilitate those visitors&#39; interactions with P2PU&#39;s Web sites. P2PU may make the aggregate data it obtains publicly available. If the data is made available, none of the information will be personally-identifying information or potentially-personally-identifying information.</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>How to Control the Use of Cookies. --</strong> P2PU visitors have the ability to accept or decline cookies. P2PU visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by P2PU, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to P2PU&#39;s Web sites. Certain features of P2PU&#39;s Web sites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tPrivacy Policy Changes</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be reflected on this page. Substantive changes will also be announced through the standard mechanisms through which P2PU communicates with the P2PU community, including P2PU&#39;s &quot;P2PU-announce&quot; (<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-announce\" title=\"http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-announce\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-announce</a>) mailing list and newsgroup.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tFor More Information</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tIf you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact P2PU at: thepeople [AT] P2PU.org.</p> \r\n<p><em>Attribution: Substantive parts of this document are based on the Mozilla Drumbeat privacy policy (<a href=\"http://www.drumbeat.org/privacy-policy\" title=\"http://www.drumbeat.org/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.drumbeat.org/privacy-policy</a>).<br /></em></p> \r\n",

P2PU crea un modelo para aprender durante toda la vida que complementa los modelos tradicionales de educaci\u00f3n superior formal.  Al potencializar Internet y los materiales educativos en l\u00ednea y abiertos, P2PU posibilita oportunidades educativas de alta calidad y bajo costo.

Estamos articulando estos valores para guiar nuestras acciones, pero P2PU siempre ha tratado de hacer y nuestras acciones a su vez nos ayudar\u00e1n a probar y refinar estos valores.</p> \r\n<p><strong>P2PU es abierto</strong>: Compartir y colaborar abiertamente permite la participaci\u00f3n, la innovaci\u00f3n y la responsabilidad. Nuestra comunidad es abierta de forma que cualquiera puede participar.  Nuestro contenido es abierto de forma que cualquiera puede usarlo.  Nuestro modelo y tecnolog\u00eda son abiertos para posibilitar la experimentaci\u00f3n y el mejoramiento contin\u00fao.  Y nuestros procesos son abiertos para ser responsables con nuestra comunidad. </p> \r\n<p><strong>P2PU es una comunidad</strong>: P2PU es un proyecto centrado en la comunidad y nuestro modelo de gobierno refleja esto. P2PU es dirigido por voluntarios, que est\u00e1n involucrados en todos los aspectos del proyecto.  Como miembros de esta comunidad, hablamos y obramos con civilidad, tolerancia, y respeto por otras opiniones, gente y perspectivas.  Nos esforzamos por la calidad en un proceso de evaluaci\u00f3n, retroalimentaci\u00f3n y revisi\u00f3n, proceso orientado por la comunidad .   </p> \r\n<p><strong>P2PU es apasionada del aprendizaje por pares</strong>: P2PU se trata de ense\u00f1anza y aprendizaje por pares para pares.  Todos tienen algo para contribuir y todos tiene algo que aprender.  Todo somos profesores y todos somos aprendices. Nos responsabilisamos por nuestro propio aprendizaje y el de los dem\u00e1s.  </p> \r\n \r\n<h2>Mapa del Proyecto</h2> \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\tHace dos a\u00f1os P2PU comenz\u00f3 con cinco personas y desde entonces ha crecido hasta ser una comunidad de cerca de 1,000.  Durante ese tiempo, P2PU ha realizado tres ciclos (semestres) de cursos, con el n\u00famero de cursos ofrecidos duplicandose en cada oportunidad.   Los organizadores de cursos P2PU son voluntarios(as) que env\u00edan su idea de curso y reciben guianza de un amplio grupo de expertos y miembros de la comunidad para crear un syllabus integral de materiales abiertos y una estructura social alrededor.  Nuestra actual trayector\u00eda incluye un sistema de apoyo soportado por la comunidad para organizadores y participantes mientras escalamos.  En el siguiente nivel, estamos haciendo alianzas con organizaciones externas para agrupar cursos y crear escuelas con reputaci\u00f3n de aprendizaje abierto y con una definitiva trayector\u00eda en su carrera.  Un ejemplo que brilla es la Escuela de Webcraft de Mozilla/P2PU.  Las alianzas en sinerg\u00edas con organizaciones de peso le dan a los participantes de P2PU una educaci\u00f3n abierta cre\u00edble. </p> \r\n\r\n<h2>P2PU Personal</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>P2PU se compone de una gran comunidad de voluntarios comprometidos y entusiastas, y un peque\u00f1o equipo de personal. Las siguientes personas forman parte del personal P2PU que mantener las cosas funcionando sin problemas:</p>\r\n\r\n<div id='member_relationships'>\r\n<ul class=\"following\">\r\n<li><a title=\"Philipp Schmidt, Director\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/Philipp\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/philipp.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Bekka Kahn, Mother, Wrangler\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/Rebecca%20Kahn\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/rebecca.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Alison Cole, Guide\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/alison\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/alison.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Karen Gabriels, Treasurer, a treasure\" href=\"http://p2pu.org/en/karengabriels\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/karen.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"John Britton, Evangelist\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/johndbritton\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/john.jpeg' ></a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Zuzel Vera, Tech Guru\" href=\"http://new.p2pu.org/en/zuzelvp\"><img class=\"member-picture\" src='/media/images/staffs/zuzel.jpg' ></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2> \r\n\tAcreditaci\u00f3n</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tMientras que el aprendizaje por si mismo es una meta valiosa, lograr cr\u00e9dito por lo que se ha hecho tambi\u00e9n es importante para ganar oportunidades sociales y econ\u00f3micas.  Mientras P2PU se desarrolla, estamos experimentando nuevas formas de reconocer el aprendizaje.   La valoraci\u00f3n de los dem\u00e1s llega a ser intrinseco en el proceso de aprendizaje de la comunidad. Como en las comunidades de programas de fuentes abiertas, los participantes en un grupo de aprendizaje se dan retroalimentaci\u00f3n mutua, revisando y mejorando el trabajo de otros&#39;. Los pares en el curso evaluar\u00e1n el trabajo de otros y se ofrecer\u00e1n certificados de P2PU en l\u00ednea para se\u00f1alar que usted ha completado un curso.  Queremos que quienes aprenden reciban reconocimiento por sus logros, pero por cuenta nuestra no emitimos certificados oficiales o acreditados de ninguna clase.   Estamos trabajando en un acreditaci\u00f3n-cruzada con unos pocos socios, pero los certificados de P2PU son m\u00e1s &quot;obras de arte&quot; que &quot;grados.&quot;</p> \r\n\r\n<h2> \r\n\tSoporte</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU es operado ampliamente por voluntarios, sin embargo tambi\u00e9n hemos recibido financiaci\u00f3n inicial para cubrir algunos costos b\u00e1sicos tanto de la Fundaci\u00f3n Hewlett, como de la Fundaci\u00f3n Shuttleworth.

El campo del aprendizaje en l\u00ednea, del aprendizaje abierto/par a par y colaborativo est\u00e1 en r\u00e1pido desarrollo, tanto cuando se llega a plataformas tecnologicas disponibles y modelos sociales de organizaci\u00f3n.   Hemos sido inspirados por cierto n\u00famero de casos piloto muy exitosos y vemos P2PU como una construcci\u00f3n sobre estos cursos pioneros. Estaremos monitoreando continuamente y evaluando el progreso, haciendo muchos cambios en el camino y ojala desarrollando nuevos modelos de colaboraci\u00f3n que no s\u00f3lo beneficien a P2PU sin a otros proyectos cuyas comunidades de voluntarios est\u00e9n intentando trabajar juntos.  Promoveremos y apoyaremos activamente la investigaci\u00f3n, especialmente investigaci\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n, sobre el modelo de P2PU y haremos prioridad el compartir informaci\u00f3n y las reflexiones con la comunidad amplia de manera regular.  La P2PU lucir\u00e1 muy diferente en tres o cinco a\u00f1os de como ha comenzado, pero la \u00fanica forma de llegar all\u00ed es saltando e intentando.  Invitamos a quienes est\u00e9 interesado en realizar investigaci\u00f3n sobre P2PU a contactarnos. </p> \r\n\r\n",

Estas Pol\u00edticas de Privacidad explican la recolecci\u00f3n, uso y publicaci\u00f3n de &ldquo;informaci\u00f3n de identidad&rdquo; a trav\u00e9s de todos los sitios web P2PU hospedado bajo el dominio p2pu.org (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.p2pu.org\" title=\"www.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.p2pu.org</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.p2pu.org\" title=\"blog.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog.p2pu.org, <a href=\"http://archive.p2pu.org\"  title=\"archive.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.p2pu.org</a>, <a href=\"http://wiki.p2pu.org\" title=\"wiki.p2pu.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki.p2pu.org</a>, etc.).</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\tComo se usa en estas pol\u00edticas,  &ldquo;informaci\u00f3n de identidad&rdquo; significa informaci\u00f3n que permitir\u00eda a un tercero identificarlo a usted, por ejemplo, por su nombre, direcci\u00f3n o localizaci\u00f3n, n\u00famero telef\u00f3nico o direcci\u00f3n de correo.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tPrincipios de Apertura</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU es una organizaci\u00f3n abierta y transparente.  En ese esp\u00edritu, compartimos tanta informaci\u00f3n como resulta posible de nuestros productos, servicios, operaciones y asociaciones.  Los usuarios que interactuan con el sitio Web de P2PU por tanto deben entender y estar advertidos que cualquier informaci\u00f3n que identifique identidad proveida por P2PU puede ser puesta a disposici\u00f3n del p\u00fablico.  hay tres excepciones a este principio amplio, que se explican a continuaci\u00f3n. </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tLos visitantes a los sitios web de P2PU</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tExcepto como se describe a continuaci\u00f3n, P2PU no recolecta ni exige a los visitantes de sus sitios web que provean informaci\u00f3n de identidad.  Como la mayor\u00eda de operadores de sitios Web,  P2PU recolecta informaci\u00f3n que no identifica identidad, como la que los navegadores web y los servidores t\u00edpicamente ponen a disposici\u00f3n, tales como el tipo de navegador, preferencias del idioma, el sitio que refiere, y fecha y hora de cada solicitud del visitante.   P2PU tambi\u00e9n recolecta informaci\u00f3n que potencialmente permite identificar como direcci\u00f3n del Protocolo Internet (IP), que de por si no permiten identificar identidad pero que podr\u00edan usarse en cojunto con otra informaci\u00f3n para identificar identidad de usuarios. </p> \r\n<p> \r\n\tEl prop\u00f3sito de P2PU&#39;s al recolectar esta informaci\u00f3n es entender mejor como los visitantes de P2PU&#39;s utilizan sus sitios Web.  Con ese fin, P2PU puede compartir informaci\u00f3n que potencialmente identifique identidad con sus empleados, contratantes, voluntarios, y sus filiales u organizaciones relacionadas.  P2PU tambi\u00e9n puede liberar informaci\u00f3n sobre los visitantes que no permita identificar identidad (e.g. al publicar un reporte de tendencias del uso del sitio web).  En otro caso, P2PU no liberar\u00e1 publicamente informaci\u00f3n que permita identificar identidad, excepto bajo las mismas circunstancias que P2PU libera informaci\u00f3n que permita identificar identidad.    Tales circunstancias se explcian a continuaci\u00f3n.</p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tMiembros de la Comunidad</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tCiertos miembres de la comunidad P2PU (organizadores de cursos, participantes, etc.) prefieren interactuar con P2PU de formas que requieren dar a conocer a P2PU y a otros m\u00e1s sobre ellos(as).  La cantidad de informaci\u00f3n que P2PU recolecta de tales miembros depende de la naturaleza de la interacci\u00f3n.  Por ejemplo a los miembros que quieren publicar contenidos en ciertas partes de los sitios web de P2PU o que participan en sesiones de teleconferencia en vivo se les solicita suministrar nombres de usuario que identifiquen el contenido como publicado por un miembro particular.   P2PU solicita a los l\u00edderes de cursos y participantes que creen p\u00e9rfiles de usuario, que pueden incluir fotograf\u00edas y descripciones personales.  Los miembros que est\u00e9n registrados e ingresen al sitio web de P2PU pueden contactar a otros miembros mediante sus perfiles.   La informaci\u00f3n de contacto tal como direcciones de correo no est\u00e1n disponibles p\u00fablicamente en el sitio web de P2PU, si embargo si un usuario env\u00eda correo por el sitio web, la direcci\u00f3n de correo del usuario ser\u00e1 revelada al receptor. </p> \r\n<p> \r\n\tLos l\u00edderes de cursos y participantes del mismo curso posiblemente obtendr\u00e1n informaci\u00f3n que identificar\u00e1 la identidad con prop\u00f3sitos de colaboraci\u00f3n y comunicaci\u00f3n en el curso.  P2PU no se hace responsable por la divulgaci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n de contacto que identifique identidad y que sea revelada de manera voluntaria cuando participa en un curso.   </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tExepciones</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tPor regla general, los usuarios deben asumir que cualquier informaci\u00f3n que identifique de manera personal proveida por sitios web de P2PU ser\u00e1 puesta a disposici\u00f3n del p\u00fablico.  Hay tres excepciones amplias a esta regla: </p> \r\n<ul> \r\n<li> \r\n\t\tP2PU no hace p\u00fablica informaci\u00f3n que se usa para autenticar usuarios, la publicaci\u00f3n de la cual comprometer\u00eda la seguridad de los sitios web de P2PU (e.g. claves).</li> \r\n<li> \r\n\t\tP2PU no hace p\u00fablica la informaci\u00f3n disponible que haya prometido mantener en cofidencialidad en el momento de la recolecci\u00f3n. </li> \r\n<li> \r\n\t\tP2PU no libera informaci\u00f3n al p\u00fablico, que haya recolectada en relaci\u00f3n con transacciones comerciales (i.e. transacciones que involucran dinero).</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n</p><h2> \r\n\tCaracter\u00edsticas Interactivas del Producto</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tAlgunos productos o servicios de P2PU pueden contener caracter\u00edsticas que reportarn o que permiten a los usuarios reportar, los patrones de uso del usuario a P2PU.  Los reportes generados por estas caracter\u00edsticas t\u00edpicamente incluyen informaci\u00f3n que no permite identificar identidad tal como la configuraci\u00f3n del computador del usuario y el c\u00f3digo que se ejecutaba si ocurri\u00f3 un problema.    Algunas de las caracter\u00edsticas dan al usuario la opci\u00f3n de dar informaci\u00f3n que permite identificar identidad.   P2PU puede analizar la informaci\u00f3n proveida por estas caracter\u00edsticas interactivas de los productos para lograr una mejor comprensi\u00f3n de como est\u00e1 siendo usado el producto. </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tProtecci\u00f3n de Cierta Informaci\u00f3n que permite Identificar Identidad</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tDonde P2PU haya recolectado informaci\u00f3n que permita identificar identidad sujeta a una de las tres excepciones descritas anteriormente en la secci\u00f3n Miembros de la Comunidad, revelar\u00e1 esa informaci\u00f3n s\u00f3lo a aquellos de sus empleados, voluntarios, contratantes, filiales y organizaciones relacionadas que necesiten conocer esa informaci\u00f3n para procesarla a nombre de P2PU y cuando hayan aceptado no revelarla a otros.  Algunos de estos empleados, voluntarios, contratantes, filiales y organizaciones relacionadas puede estar localizadas fuera del pa\u00eds del visitante; al usar los sitios web de P2PU, el visitante concede transferirles tal informaci\u00f3n. P2PU no arrienda ni vende tal informaci\u00f3n a nadie.  Fuera de sus empleados, contratantes, filiales u organizaciones relacionadas, como se describi\u00f3 antes, P2PU revela tal informaci\u00f3n s\u00f3lo cuando lo requiera la ley, o cuando P2PU crea de buena fe que revelarla es razonablemente necesario para protejer la propedad o los derechos de P2PU, de los miembros de la comunidad de P2PU, o del p\u00fablico en general. </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tActualizaci\u00f3n de Informaci\u00f3n que permita Identificar Identidad</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU permite a los usuarios actualizar libremente y corregir su informaci\u00f3n de identidad como se mantiene en P2PU. Para hacerlo, los usuarios deben buscar enlaces o informaci\u00f3n de contacto disponible en cualquier de los sitios web de P2PU que almacene la informaci\u00f3n relevante, o contactar a P2PU por correo.   A los usuarios se les permite desactivar su perfil, sin embargo, las contribuciones al sitio web de P2PU no ser\u00e1 eliminadas cuando el perfil se desactive. </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tNi\u00f1os y Ni\u00f1as</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tEl sitio web de P2PU no est\u00e1 dirigido a ni\u00f1os o ni\u00f1as menores de 13 a\u00f1os.  Consistentes con el Acto de Protecci\u00f3n de Privacidad de los Ni\u00f1os en L\u00ednea de Estados Unidos de 1998 (COPPA), nunca solicitaremos informaci\u00f3n de identidad de alguien menor de 13 a\u00f1os sin consentimiento parental.  Nuestros T\u00e9rminos de Uso expresamente establecen que los usuarios deben ser mayores de 18 a\u00f1os para usar los sitios web de P2PU.  Cualquier persona que de su informaci\u00f3n de identidad a P2PU por sitios web de P2PU indica que tiene 18 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s.  </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tGalletas y GIFs planos</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>\u00bfQu\u00e9 son las Galletas? -- </strong>Una galleta (en ingl\u00e9s <em>cookie</em>) es una cadena de informaci\u00f3n que un sitio web almacena en el computador del visitante, y que el navegador del visitante da al sitio web cada vez que el visitante regresa.  La mayor\u00eda de sitios web usan galletas.  Como el navegadore provee esta informaci\u00f3n de la galleta al sitio web en cada visita, las galletas sirven como una especie de etiqueta que permite al sitio web reconocer un navegador cuando regresa al sitio.  El nombre de dominio de las galletas P2PU identificar\u00e1 claramente su afiliaci\u00f3n con P2PU y, cuando sea aplicable, a sus terceros que le proveen servicios.</p> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>\u00bfQu\u00e9 son GIFs claros? --</strong> Los gifs claros (tambi\u00e9n conocidos como faros del web) se usan en combinaci\u00f3n con las galletas para ayudar a operadores de sitios web a entender como los visitantes interactuan con sus sitios web.  Un gif claro es t\u00edpicamente una imagen usada en combinaci\u00f3n con galletas para ayudar a operadores de sitios web a entender como los visitantes interactuan con sus sitios web.   Un gif claro es t\u00edpicamente una imagen transparente (usualmente de 1 pixel x 1 pixel) que se ubica en un sitio.  El uso de un gif claro permite al sitio medir las acciones de los visitantes al abrir la p\u00e1gina que contiene el gif claro.   Hace m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil seguir y registrar las actividades de un navegadores reconocido, tal como la ruta de las p\u00e1ginas visitadas en un sitio web. </p> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>\u00bfC\u00f3mo usamos las galletas y los GIFs claros? --</strong> Los sitios web de P2PU usan galletas y pueden usar gifs claros en el futuro.  Estas herramientas ayudan a P2PU a identificar y rastrear visitantes, su uso de los sitios web de P2PU, y sus preferencias de acceso a lo largo de m\u00faltiples requerimientos y visitas a los sitios web de P2PU.   El t\u00e9rmino que usualmente se emplea para describir esto es &quot;an\u00e1lisis web&quot; y las galletas y gifs claros son las herramientas con las cuales un propietario de sitio web recolecta estos datos de an\u00e1lisis web.  P2PU usar\u00e1 datos de an\u00e1lisis web s\u00f3lo para determinar patron de uso agregado para nuestros sitios web como se describi\u00f3 antes.  P2PU usa la informaci\u00f3n dada por las galletas y los gifs claros para desarrollar un mejor entendimiento de como los visitantes usan los sitios web de P2PU, y para facilitar la interacci\u00f3n de esos visitantes con los sitios web de P2PU.   P2PU puede poner a disposici\u00f3n del p\u00fablico los datos agregados.  Si los datos se publican, nada de esta informaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 para identificar identidad o para identificarla potencialmente. </p> \r\n<p> \r\n\t<strong>Como controlar el uso de Galletas --</strong> Los visitantes a P2PU tienen la habilidad de aceptar o rechazar galletas.  Los visitantes de P2PU que no deseen tener galletas en sus computadores por parte de P2PU, sus contratantes, o terceros que provean servicios deben configurar sus navegadores para rechazar galletas antes de enlazarse a sitios web de P2PU.  Ciertas caracter\u00edsticas de los sitios web de P2PU pueden no funcionar apropiadamente sin la ayuda de galletas. </p> \r\n<h2> \r\n\tCambios a las Pol\u00edticas de Privacidad</h2> \r\n<p> \r\n\tP2PU puede cambiar sus Pol\u00edticas de Privacidad de vez en cuando.

This information will continue to be linked to from your badge wherever you decide to share it, adding more validity and evidence to your skills and achievements. While these are alpha badges, they are endorsed by Mozilla and will continue to be credentials that you can use to share with various stakeholders like potential employers or peer communities.</p>\r\n  \r\n<h2>Mozilla Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI)</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In order to allow you to share your badges with other sites and communities, P2PU has plugged into the <a href=\"http://alpha.badgehub.org/\">Mozilla Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI)</a>, which allows you to manage a single badge collection, including badges from P2PU as well as other badge issuers and learning providers across the web, and then manage those badges and share them out accordingly. The OBI is using <a href=\"https://browserid.org/\">BrowserID</a>, which will allow you to maintain a single identity through the email address you registered at P2PU.</p>\r\n<p>The OBI is currently in the alpha version with means limited functionality and only 1 issuer - P2PU. Mozilla is launching the beta version with more functionality and a handful of additional issuers in the following months and this will be followed by the public 1.0 launch in 2012. At that point all issuers will be able to join and there will be even more of a badge ecosystem. If you <a href=\"http://p2pu.org/en/profile/edit/badges\">send your P2PU badges</a> now, they will be rolled over with each release and you will seamlessly capitalize on the new features as they are completed.</p>\r\n",
