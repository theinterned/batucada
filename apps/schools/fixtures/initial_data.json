Are you interested in developing the skills and network necessary to do so?</p>\n\n<p>The P2PU School of Social Innovation is a global, open source community for organizing peer study groups on topics like conflict resolution, project management for social innovators, and social innovation in education.  SoSI is united by the common purpose of helping all people strengthen skills that are important for social innovators.</p>\n\n<p>SoSI achieves this through free, peer-designed-and-directed study groups, which use a combination of online and offline project-based learning.  The online platform allows study groups of a virtually unlimited size to access and remix high-quality open source curriculum, lectures and other resources for deepening theoretical understanding in international, collaborative teams, while participant-led offline citizen circles provide the opportunity for participants to work in their local context and to develop skills like empathy, resilience, and cooperation- skills which are often learned best through deeper practice, in person.</p>\n<h2>\n\tAbout Us</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/33982467/SoSI\" title=\"Find out more about SoSI\">About SoSI</a></li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.citizencircles.com\" title=\"About Citizen Circles\">About Citizen Circles</a></li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/33982522/Creating-a-citizen-circle\" title=\"What is a Citizen Circle?\">What is a Citizen Circle?</a></li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/citizencircles\" title=\"Contact SoSI\">Contact Us</a></li>\n</ul>",
